setup-py-upgrade
================

upgrade a setup.py to declarative metadata

## installation

```bash
pip install setup-py-upgrade
```

## cli

Consult the help for the latest usage:

```console
$ setup-py-upgrade --help
usage: setup-py-upgrade [-h] directory

positional arguments:
  directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

pass the root directory of the repository you'd like to convert

the script overwrites `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` when run

## sample output

```console
$ setup-py-upgrade ../pre-commit
../pre-commit/setup.py and ../pre-commit/setup.cfg written!
$ tail -n999 ../pre-commit/setup.{py,cfg}
==> ../pre-commit/setup.py <==
from setuptools import setup
setup()

==> ../pre-commit/setup.cfg <==

## what versions of setuptools / pip does the output work with?

- `pip>=1.5` (when installing from a wheel)
    - released 2014-01-02
- `setuptools>=30.3` (when building from source)
    - released 2016-12-08
- `virtualenv>=15.2` (to get a sufficient setuptools via `--no-download`)
   - released 2018-03-21

## what is not supported

declarative metadata does not support `ext_modules` or setuptools plugins --
those must stay in `setup.py`.  If you're converting a project which uses one
of those, you'll see a message like:

```console
$ setup-py-upgrade ../future-breakpoint/
ext_modules= is not supported in setup.cfg
```

To convert those, temporarily remove the offending constructs from `setup.py`,
then run `setup-py-upgrade`, then paste them back into the file.
